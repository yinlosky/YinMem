Now start reading from Accumulo to get vector...

Read vector: 5.4013s

Saving vector to global vector file takes: 0.86993s

Saving vector to global file costs 6.6143s
Now each machine makes its own copy of vector
Submitting saveVectorToTFS on 16 processor(s).

Now start reading from Accumulo to get vector...

Read vector: 5.1675s

Saving vector to global vector file takes: 0.88116s

Saving vector to global file costs 6.4352s
Now each machine makes its own copy of vector
Submitting saveVectorToTFS on 16 processor(s).

Now start reading from Accumulo to get vector...

Read vector: 5.2737s

Saving vector to global vector file takes: 0.83861s

Saving vector to global file costs 6.4656s
Now each machine makes its own copy of vector
Submitting saveVectorToTFS on 16 processor(s).
